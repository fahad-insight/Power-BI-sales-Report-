# Power-BI-sales-Report-
This report is structured as a narrative journey:

1: Landing Page / KPIs
A dashboard summarizing overall sales, profit, and order volume. Stakeholders get a quick snapshot of company health.

2: Sales Trends
A time-series visualization shows growth, dips, and seasonal variations. Useful for identifying best-performing months or quarters.

3: Product Performance
Bar/column charts highlight the top revenue-driving products while pointing out low-performing ones that may need reevaluation.
